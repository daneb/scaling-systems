Here’s a list of common problems encountered when building and maintaining distributed systems and microservices:

1. Service Communication

	•	Latency and Network Failures: Unreliable networks can lead to timeouts, retries, and inconsistent state.
	•	Protocol Compatibility: Inconsistent APIs or version mismatches between services.
	•	Message Ordering: Ensuring messages are processed in the correct order when using asynchronous communication.

2. Data Consistency

	•	Eventual Consistency: Maintaining data integrity across services when not using strong consistency models.
	•	Distributed Transactions: Implementing reliable and performant solutions (e.g., Saga patterns) for operations spanning multiple services.
	•	Data Duplication: Handling redundant data copies for performance while avoiding stale data.

3. Scaling

	•	Load Balancing: Efficiently distributing traffic among services or instances.
	•	Service Discovery: Dynamically finding service instances as they scale up or down.
	•	Database Scalability: Balancing reads, writes, and storage requirements across multiple services.

4. Fault Tolerance and Reliability

	•	Circuit Breakers: Preventing cascading failures when dependent services are unavailable.
	•	Retries and Exponential Backoff: Avoiding overload on failing services while ensuring eventual recovery.
	•	Stateful Services: Managing state in services that fail or restart.

5. Observability

	•	Logging and Monitoring: Ensuring sufficient and consistent logs across services.
	•	Tracing: Implementing distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to track requests across microservices.
	•	Metrics: Gathering and analyzing service-specific and system-wide performance metrics.

6. Deployment and Updates

	•	Dependency Management: Ensuring compatibility across services when versions change.
	•	Canary Deployments: Testing new changes with a small subset of traffic to avoid global failures.
	•	Configuration Management: Safely managing configurations across multiple environments and services.

7. Security

	•	Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure, centralized identity management (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID).
	•	Data Encryption: Securing communication and sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
	•	API Gateway Vulnerabilities: Avoiding bottlenecks or misconfigurations at the gateway level.

8. Complexity and Team Coordination

	•	Service Boundaries: Properly defining boundaries to avoid tight coupling between services.
	•	Cross-Team Collaboration: Managing dependencies and ownership among teams working on interconnected services.
	•	Onboarding New Developers: Ensuring new developers can navigate and understand the system.

9. Testing

	•	Integration Testing: Ensuring services work together as expected.
	•	Environment Parity: Replicating production-like environments for testing.
	•	Mocking and Stubbing: Balancing realism with performance in test environments.

10. Performance

	•	Cold Starts: Optimizing startup times, especially for serverless or containerized services.
	•	Resource Contention: Managing shared resources like databases, queues, or caches under load.
	•	Bottlenecks: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks in the critical path of service execution.

11. Operational Challenges

	•	Service Overhead: Managing infrastructure complexity for multiple services.
	•	Health Checks: Ensuring services properly report their status.
	•	Service Lifecycle Management: Handling the addition, deprecation, or removal of services gracefully.

12. Cost

	•	Cloud Costs: Balancing performance, availability, and resource usage to minimize costs.
	•	Over-Provisioning: Allocating more resources than necessary for fault tolerance.
	•	Monitoring Tool Costs: Handling costs associated with observability tools.

13. Service Versioning

	•	Backward Compatibility: Ensuring changes in a service don’t break downstream consumers.
	•	Deprecation: Managing old versions of APIs and their eventual retirement.

14. Vendor Lock-In

	•	Cloud-Specific Features: Designing services that are portable and not tied to a single vendor’s technology.
	•	Infrastructure Independence: Avoiding deep integration with proprietary deployment tools or frameworks.

15. Event Streaming and Asynchronous Issues

	•	Dead Letter Queues: Handling failed messages in queues.
	•	Duplicate Events: Ensuring idempotency in event handling to avoid inconsistent states.
	•	Event Ordering: Managing scenarios where events may arrive out of sequence.
